This is the repo of my Space Engineering Master Thesis.
The topic is: Developement of a fully magnetic attitude determination and control of a Nanosatellite.
I am going to study first the literature about actual and past technology used in this field.
After building a strong background in the related topic I will improve the algorithms used in particular for the attitude determination and for the control.
My primary goal is to improve efficiency and performance.
